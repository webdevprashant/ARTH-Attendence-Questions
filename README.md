ðŸ‘‰ What is Authentication ?                   <br>
ðŸ‘‰ What is remote user and local user ?        <br>
ðŸ‘‰ How to know the script of firefox ?<br>
ðŸ‘‰ What is Zenity ?

ðŸ‘‰ How you can print the date command using zenity ?<br>

ðŸ‘‰ How you will check all commands run till date ?<br>

ðŸ‘‰ How you can display the text using echo command ?<br>

ðŸ‘‰ What is TTS ?<br>

ðŸ‘‰ What is the command to make the voices in male/female an also in different languages ?<br>

ðŸ‘‰ Why we use pipe ( | ) symbol in linux ?<br>

ðŸ‘‰ How to run linux/system commands using python. <br>

ðŸ‘‰What is the use of ps command in linux.  <br>

ðŸ‘‰How to run any program in background and again stop it in linux.  <br>

1. To give os access to right user by asking username and password is called authentication  <br>
2.
Local user - The user who access os physically in same location  <br>
Remote user - The user who access os from a different location   <br>
3. gedit /usr/bin/firefox    <br>
4. Zenity is a tool or command to show GTK graphical dialog boxes like warning, error, entry etc  <br>
5. zenity --info --text="$(date)"   <br>
6. history    <br>
7. echo "write whatever text want to display"  <br>
8. Stands for text to speech, we can use espeak-ng command to speak text, output of command, read file etc.   <br>
9. espeak-ng -v Language+M/F text   <br>
Ex - espeak-ng -v hi+f2 Hello Sir  <br>
10. We can connect stdin and stdout or input /output or multiple commands using piping. Ex - date | espeak-ng  <br>
11. import os the run os.system("command name")    <br>
12. Ps displays s snapshot of current process running. We can use multiple options like ps -aux which shows all process running in system.  <br>
13. Background run - gedit &, firefox &  <br>
To Stop This process - ctrl + z   <br>



                                                             *ARTH 2.0 27 January 2022*

1) What is difference between linear and nonlinear ?   <br>
2) What is the example of linear and non-linear ?  <br>
3) How many ways is there for Travers Binary Tree and which ones ? <br>
4) What is difference between Depth first traversal and Breadth first traversal?<br>
5) What is approach for traverse using pre-order ?<br>


1. Linear data structures means every item order is straight like array , linked list.    <br>
Non Linear Data structure means items are not in straight way like Tree. So Tree is non linear data structure. <br>
2. Linear DS :- Array, Linked list  <br>
Non Linear DS :- Tree.  <br>
3. 4 ways.  <br>
Depth first Search (Traverse) <br>
- In order Traverse <br>
- Pre order Traverse <br>
- Post order Traverse <br>
Breath first Search (Traverse) <br>
- Level order Traverse. <br>
4. Depth first :- 1st from tree go to sub trees, categories until reach to leaf nodes then pick items 1st we go depth instead seeing entire picture of tree called Depth first Traverse. <br>
Breath first :- In breath first we find shortest path which closure to source. <br>
5. Approach / Algorithm :-   <br>
Root Node  <br>
|  <br>
|  <br>
Left Node <br>
|  <br>
|  <br>
Right Node <br>

Ex :- A(root node) , B (left Node), C, Right node.  <br>
OUTPUT :-. A, B, C  <br>
